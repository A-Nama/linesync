```what's up? welcome to linesync.```

this isn't just some code. it's a whole mood. it's for when you have something to say and you want it to hit just right. basically, it's a tool to create those clean, minimalistic, word-by-word kinetic typography videos for your favorite songs. all in your browser.

### the tea üçµ
so, here's the origin story. i was having a moment, feeling like a total bapsae (Î±ÅÏÉà). like, everyone thinks you're doing nothing, but you're out here legs about to snap from trying to keep up. major bapsae energy.

i wanted to post the english translation of BTS's "Baepsae" (Silver Spoon) to capture that exact feeling. i looked for a good lyric video, but the vibe was just... off. none of them hit right.

and in a moment of pure "fine, i'll do it myself" energy, i decided to just... build the tool to make the video easily. in like, a few hours.

so, ```linesync``` was born. out of spite, passion, and a deep-seated need for the aesthetics to match the lyrics. (even without video editing skills)
---------------------------
### how to use it
it's dead simple, fr.

- drop the audio: upload your song.
- paste the vibes: copy-paste your lyrics. one line per line.
- tap to the beat: play the song and just tap a button for each line. get that timing perfect. the app even detects the main beats for you to make the words pop.
- smash generate: hit the button, wait a bit (it's doing some serious work in the background), and boom. you get a downloadable ```.webm``` video file.

### what's under the hood?
this whole thing is built on pure, unadulterated, client-side vibes. no servers, no accounts, no nonsense.

  HTML, CSS, JavaScript: the OG trio.

  Tailwind CSS: for making it look clean without a fuss.

  ```Anime.js```: for the smooth animations.

  ```CCapture.js```: the real MVP for rendering the video right in your browser.

### glow up soon?
idk, maybe. this was a "coded it in a few hours" kind of project. but who knows? if the vibes are right, maybe we'll add more features. for now, it does what it needs to do.
